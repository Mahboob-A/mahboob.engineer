# Phase 7 — Experience deep-dive routes + interactive hero terminal

**Phase:** 7 — Experience deep-dive + Hero terminal
**Phase status:** in-progress
**Date started:** 2026-07-16

**Goal:** Two independent features shipping under one phase because they
share the same Phase 7 file:

1. **`/log/[id]` deep-dive pages** — one route per experience entry in
   `EXPERIENCE`. Each page has full prose, all bullets, related projects,
   related blog posts, and tag chips linking to `/stack#<id>`. Landing
   `DeployLog` cards become click-thru entries; chips stay individually
   clickable to the stack graph.
2. **Interactive terminal under the hero Algocode diagram** — fills the
   dead space in the Hero's right column on `lg+`. Clickable command
   chips (`whoami` / `projects` / `stack` / `latest` / `contact` / `help`)
   trigger a typewriter-rendered result. v1 ships static payloads; the
   RAG-LLM upgrade is documented in `docs/RAG_TERMINAL.md` for a future
   task.

**Result:** After Phase 7, every experience entry has its own URL and
its own narrative page; the Hero surfaces 6 additional discovery paths
without scrolling; and a runbook exists to upgrade the terminal into
a real LLM-backed chat later.

Master plan tasks in this phase (T7.1 → T7.7):

1. **T7.1** — Schema extension + phase file (this task)
2. T7.2 — Landing DeployLog card-wrap + chip-link wiring
3. T7.3 — New `/log/[id]` route + `BuildNotes`/`RelatedStack`/`RelatedWriting` file-local components
4. T7.4 — Add 3 prose drafts + `relatedProjects` arrays to each entry
5. T7.5 — Sitemap + cross-link into `/work/<slug>`
6. T7.6 — `HeroTerminal` v1 (static, clickable chips, typewriter)
7. T7.7 — RAG runbook + `.env.example` keys

## T7.1 — Schema extension + phase file

**Task status:** in-progress
**Commit:** `<this commit>`
**Date:** 2026-07-16

### What shipped

- **`data/experience.ts`** — extended `ExperienceItem` with two optional
  fields:
  - `notes?: string` — 4-paragraph prose for the `/log/[id]` deep-dive.
    Same shape as `PROJECTS[].notes`. Split on `\n\n` at render time.
    Backward-compatible — missing `notes` falls back to `bullets.join('\n\n')`.
  - `relatedProjects?: string[]` — PROJECTS slug list. Drives the
    "Related Projects" grid on `/log/[id]`. Empty/missing → section omitted.
- File docstring updated to reflect new consumers (`/log/[id]`) and
  document the Phase 7 schema additions.
- **`progress/work-progress-p7.md`** — phase file with 7-task breakdown.
  Created empty at the start of the task; this section is the first
  task record.

### Decisions

- **Both fields are optional.** No existing consumer breaks (TypeScript
  `?:` semantics). Future edits to add `notes`/`relatedProjects` are
  additive — entries that don't have them just render with bullets-only
  and no related-projects section.
- **`notes` is a single string with `\n\n` separators** — same shape as
  `PROJECTS[].notes` (T3.3). This makes the rendering helper portable
  between the two pages; T7.3 will reuse the file-local `BuildNotes`
  component from `app/work/[slug]/page.tsx`.
- **No `slug` field** — `entry.id` is already the URL slug. The 3
  experience ids (`taply`, `nexbell`, `innovative-it`) are URL-safe.
- **No new helpers** — `EXPERIENCE_BY_ID` already exists and is the
  correct lookup for `generateStaticParams` + `notFound()` resolution.
- **`relatedProjects` is a slug list, not a lookup map.** Lets the
  consumer control ordering (Taply puts Taply first, NexBell skips if
  no projects align).

### Caveats / pending

- **No `notes` content yet** — T7.4 adds prose drafts to all 3 entries.
- **No `relatedProjects` content yet** — T7.4 sets hand-curated arrays
  per entry.
- **`EXPERIENCE_BY_ID` is frozen** (T3.1 decision) — won't reflect
  runtime mutations, which is fine (the registry is static).
- **Git author identity**: per standing instruction.

### Verified

- `pnpm typecheck` → clean (the new optional fields don't break any
  existing consumer).
- `pnpm lint` → clean.
- `pnpm build` → 38 routes, 0 warnings (no consumers added in this
  task — T7.3 wires the consumers).
- **Type-check smoke** — added `notes: "test"` + `relatedProjects: ["taply"]`
  to a temporary clone of the Taply entry, ran typecheck → clean; removed
  the temporary clone. Confirms the new fields don't break anything.
